Title: A Generator of Mappable Chromosomal Regions Based on K-mer Length
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Deivydas Giedrimas, Pariksheet Nanda
Maintainer: Deivydas Giedrimas <giedrimd@gmail.com>
Description: Taking a BSgenome input, mappable regions are determined from base
    pair-only regions of the chromosome sequence, and split into reads of 
    length k. These kmers are compared to a PDict dicitonary, also derived from
    the chromosomal sequence to indicate the number of hits, and eliminate
    unmappable regions.
